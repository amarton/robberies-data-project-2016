        <p>Baltimore has seen a substantial rise in robberies this year. Carjackings are up 38% across the city and Baltimore’s downtown neighborhood has seen a 63% jump in street robberies. And things only seem to be getting worse-- October was the worst month for carjackings in the city and November saw the highest number of street robberies.</p>
        <p>While many have focused on the city’s high homicide numbers (which surpassed 300 for the second year in a row), robberies are up much more significantly year-over-year. Data from Open Baltimore shows that Baltimore has seen a 7% rise in total robberies, with 5,036 so far in 2016* up from 4,717 total robberies in 2015 .</p>
        <p>Baltimore police classify robberies in four categories: carjacking, commercial, residential, and street robberies. Two of those categories-- carjackings and street robberies-- are up significantly. Carjackings rose 34% this year, from 283 in 2015 to 380 in 2016. Street robberies have seen an 11% jump in 2016, with 3,126 total street robberies in 2015 up to 3,456 in 2016. See map above to explore 2016 Baltimore carjackings and street robberies.</p>
        <p>The data does reveal some positive developments: residential and commercial robberies saw declines or only slight increases year-over-year, as further discussed below.</p>

        <p>The Southern district was hit hard by carjackings in 2016, with a total of 20 incidents so far this year. This is the highest number of any district and represents a 200% rise in carjackings in the Southern from 2015.</p>
        <p>Carjackings were also up significantly in the Central district (77%), the Western district (68%) and the Southeastern district (64%) in 2016. It is worth noting that carjackings were flat in the Eastern district and down 46% year-over-year in the Northeastern district.</p>
        <p>The data also breaks robberies down by neighborhood. Most neighborhoods saw carjacking numbers in the low single digits in 2016. However, the following neighborhoods all had more than 6 carjackings each.*</p><style>/* info (hed, dek, source, credit) */

        <p>Several high profile carjackings have been in the news this year. In May, <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-fender-bender-carjacking-20160504-story.html" target="_new">Baltimore police warned motorists</a> to beware of fender-benders being caused deliberately after a string of armed carjackings in the city. "It's been widespread. It hasn't been isolated to any particular area of the city or any particular time," said T.J. Smith, the Police Department's chief spokesman. Several suspects were eventually arrested in that case but police were quoted as saying that the crimes were continuing to occur even after several arrests were made.</p>
        <p>In October, a woman was carjacked in East Baltimore while unloading groceries and the suspect drove off with her <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-amber-alert-20161026-story.html" target="_new">11-month-old baby in the car.</a> The child was found more than two hours later on a sidewalk in Northeast Baltimore. A 15-year-old was charged with the crime. </p>
        <p>Also in October, detectives spotted armed carjacking suspects after using recent trends to correctly predict that the suspects would head to Cherry Hill. As two detectives prepared to make an arrest, one of the officers accidentally  <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-officer-shot-20161012-story.html" target="_new">shot himself in the wrist</a> and the suspects escaped.</p>

        <p>Looking at these incidents over time, street robberies have steadily risen over the past six years. With 3,456 street robberies so far in 2016, Baltimore has seen a 28% rise in these crimes since 2011 (when there were 2,490).

        <div class="graphic_title">EXAMINING STREET ROBBERIES IN DOWNTOWN</div>
        <p>Baltimore’s Downtown neighborhood contained the most street robberies by far-- 225 incidents, more than the entire Western District combined. This represents a 63% jump in that neighborhood. In fact, the number of robberies in downtown held steady at around 140 per year since 2011 before surging this year.</p>
        <p>Downtown is the neighborhood located just north of the Inner Harbor, bordered by Lombard St. to the south, Paca St. to the west, Franklin St. to the north, and Fallsway to the east. It includes Lexington Market, Royal Farms Arena, Hippodrome Theater and War Memorial Plaza.</p><div style="width:100%;max-width:600px;">

        <p>The map below highlights the locations of all reported street robberies in the Downtown neighborhood. Each square represents a location where a street robbery was reported, accompanied by the number of incidents at that location. The lighter squares represent locations with multiple incidents.</p>
        <p>A few areas immediately jump out for having a high concentration of street robberies in downtown, explored in more detail below.</p>

        <p><b>Royal Farms Arena</b></p>
        <p>The Royal Farms Arena is located at 201 W. Baltimore St. It takes up a city block and is bordered by West Lombard St., South Howard St. and Hopkins Place. Looking at that single block, there were <strong>21 reported street robberies</strong> in 2016. Fanning out a few more blocks would increase that number significantly, as seen in the map below. This location is just a few blocks from the University of Maryland, downtown hotels and Camden Yards.</p><img class="map-image" src="dist/images/downtown-arena-map.png">
        <p><b>Baltimore Street</b></p>
        <p>Another hotspot for downtown street robberies is an eight-block section of Baltimore St. running between 400 East Baltimore St. (Baltimore St. and Gay St.) to 400 West Baltimore St. (Baltimore St. and Eutaw St.). Nearly <strong>60 street robberies</strong> occurred on this section of Baltimore St. and many more if you expand one block north or south along the corridor, as seen in the map below.  This corridor runs the length of downtown Baltimore and includes the Charles Center Station, the Hippodrome Theatre and the block. </p><img class="map-image" src="dist/images/downtown-baltimore-st-map.png">
        <p><b>Satatoga and Eutaw</b></p>
        <p>The corner of West Saratoga and North Eutaw is another hot spot, with <strong>18 robberies</strong> occurring near that corner in 2016 (and many more if you fan out one block in either direction). This corner is home to a busy bus stop and is one block north of Lexington Market.</p><img class="map-image" src="dist/images/downtown-saratoga-st-map.png">
        <p>Several high profile robberies have occurred in the Downtown neighborhood this year. In February,  <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-downtown-robbery-20160216-story.html" target="_new">a father and son</a> were charged in a daylight robbery near Power Plant Live where police say they struck a man in the head, knocked him to the ground and rummaged through his pockets. The suspects were spotted by an off-duty officer and arrested in the Latrobe Homes in Oldtown.</p>
        <p>In May, a man was shot while being <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-shootings-20160515-story.html" target="_new">robbed early Sunday morning</a> on Water Street. Police said the victim struggled with a man trying to rob him, and several shots were fired. Another man had been shot on the same block a month earlier.</p>
        <p>In August, police charged a man with attempted murder after he <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-attempted-murder-arrest-20160812-story.html" target="_new">shot a man during a robbery</a> in the unit block of Custom House Ave. The suspect had attempted to rob a man but the victim ran. The suspect shot at the victim but missed and was later arrested after being observed by a City Watch operator. </p>

        </div>
        <p>Residential and commercial robberies did not experience the same rapid rise as carjackings and street robberies did in 2016. In fact, both crimes have seen decreases in recent years.</p>
        <p>While residential robberies were up 3% from last year (from 434 in 2015 to 446 in 2016), those crimes are actually down 23% over the last six years. In 2011 there were 581 residential robberies in Baltimore, 135 more than this year. It is worth noting that some districts, in particular the Northeastern, have seen a sharp rise in residential robberies this year. The Northeastern district has experienced a 20% rise in residential robberies since 2015.</p>
        <p>Commercial robberies were down significantly year-over-year. Baltimore saw a 14% decline in commercial robberies this year, with 874 in 2015 down to 754 in 2016.</p>
